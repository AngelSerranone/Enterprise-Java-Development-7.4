# Lab74

## Requirements

For this lab you'll build a simple one-component Angular project, using the following image for reference https://ibb.co/RTdFwBD .

1. The colorblind mode button will toggle between this color scheme and a colorblind-friendly color scheme both for the boxes and the text. Check the following link for tips on color-blind friendly websites https://www.designmantic.com/community/website-design-guide-color-blind.php
2. The colors of the three boxes must remain different no matter the mode.
3. While hovering with the mouse over the boxes the colors of the text and the boxes should swap with each other.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
